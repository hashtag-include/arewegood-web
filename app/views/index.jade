        p.blurb We track your application's uptime and errors so you don't have to. arewegood was designed from the ground up with the idea that you shouldn't need to be a developer to know when something is wrong. The arewegood platform provides a simple view designed to answer the question "are we good?" without overwhelming you with details.

        p.blurb With the arewegood SDK, you can track, visualize, and analyze any application data. The arewegood SDK allows developers to determine what type of data they want to send to arewegood, and supports any information that can be represented in JSON. We think this provides a robust way to upload data for introspection via our web dashboard.
